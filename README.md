# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Darien

I am a computer science graduate from Michigan State University interested in solving complex problems in the fields of robotics and automation. I have recently worked as an application engineer at Kawasaki Robotics, where I consulted with systems integrators and end-users to create automation solutions for different general industry applications using Kawasaki robots.
